# Forecasting Market Asset Prices Using TensorFlow

This work focuses on forecasting market asset prices using the TensorFlow framework. Forecasts are made for a period of 5 days ahead, relying on a historical dataset spanning the previous 21 days. The predictive model is based on two key parameters: closing prices and trading volumes.

This approach allows for the creation of a model that takes into account both price dynamics (represented by closing prices) and trading volumes, which can be crucial for achieving more accurate and reliable forecasts.
